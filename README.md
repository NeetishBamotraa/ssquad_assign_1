## How to run the app

### Prerequisites

Must have installed flutter and nodejs on the your system, along with some andriod studio vms.

### Steps

1. Download the zip file, or fork and set up locally.
2. Once you have the code on your machine, go to terminal and navigate to the backend folder inside this repo.
3. Once there type in terminal the following commands to run the server:
   3.1 <code> npm install</code>
   3.2 <code> node index.js </code>
4. Now go to the frontend folder in the repo from terminal and type <code>flutter pub get</code> to set up the flutter dependencies.
5. Now start your andriod studio vm.
6. Finally run the flutter, in my VSC I pressed just <code>F5</code> to run the app.
